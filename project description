Mini Project 1
MENU DRIVEN BILLING CALCULATOR USING PYTHON
1. Project Title

Menu Driven Billing Calculator using Python

2. Problem Statement

To design and implement a menu driven billing calculator that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, view the total bill amount, and exit the program.

3. Objectives

To perform basic billing calculations

To implement menu driven programming

To understand the use of operators, input, and output

To apply loops and conditional statements

4. Tools Used

Python 3

VS Code / IDLE

5. Description

This project represents a simple billing calculator system.
The user is provided with a menu containing different billing operations. Based on the selected option, the calculator performs the required arithmetic operation on the bill amount. The system continues to operate until the user chooses to exit.
This project helps in understanding how a billing system works using basic programming concepts.

6. Algorithm

Start the program

Initialize the total bill amount

Display the billing menu

Accept the user’s choice

Perform the selected billing operation

Update the bill amount

Display the current bill amount

Repeat the process until the exit option is selected

Stop the program

7. Result

The menu driven billing calculator performs billing operations accurately and updates the total bill amount correctly based on the user’s selections.

8. Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of Python for creating a simple menu driven billing calculator. It improves understanding of basic programming concepts such as arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, and user interaction. The project is useful for beginners to learn fundamental Python programming techniques.
